Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The ``plone.recipe.command`` buildout recipe allows you to run a command
        when a buildout part is installed or updated. It is very easy to use::
        
          [buildout]
          parts = command
        
          [command]
          recipe = plone.recipe.command
          command = cat README.txt
        
        This configures a buildout part called ``command`` which lists the contents
        of README.txt when it is installed.
        
        
        Reference
        =========
        
        Unless otherwise specified all commands are run in the directory in which
        buildout is invoked. Commands have to be present in the PATH or be specified
        using an absolute pathname.
        
        The following options are supported:
        
        command
          Command to run when the buildout part is installed.
        
        update-command
          Command to run when the buildout part is updated. This happens when
          buildout is run but the configuration for this buildout part has not
          changed.
        
        location
          A list of filesystem paths that buildout should consider as being managed
          by this buildout part. These will be removed when buildout (re)installs
          or removes this part.
        
        stop-on-error
          When ``yes``, ``on`` or ``true``, buildout will stop if the command ends
          with a non zero exit code.
