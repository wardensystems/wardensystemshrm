Description: ========================
        plone.recipe.precompiler
        ========================
        
        Buildout recipe to precompiles Python and locale files in an egg list.
        
        Why precompilation?
        ===================
        
        Python ordinarily compiles .py files into .pyc or .pyo byte code files
        on demand. Likewise, applications like Plone often compile .po locale
        files into .mo representations when needed.
        
        However, if you are running a Python application as a daemon and wish
        to prevent write access to code directories, you want to do these
        compilations at buildout-time, not run-time. That's where this recipe
        comes in. Passed an egg list, it will pick up all the eggs in the
        buildout working set for the list and find and compile .py and .mo
        files in place.
        
        .mo file compilation is optional, and must be turned on.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Please note that usage changed with release 0.5. If you need the old
        options, use 0.4
        
        Common usage::
        
            [buildout]
            parts =
                ...
                precompile
            eggs = ...
        
        
            [precompile]
            recipe = plone.recipe.precompiler
            eggs = ${buildout:eggs}
            compile-mo-files = true
        
        
        This recipe may return harmless warnings regarding the inability to compile skin
        layer scripts, which typically have "return" outside of a function. While these
        warnings are harmless, you may suppress them by tuning the skip list.
        
        
        Options
        -------
        
            recipe = plone.recipe.precompiler
        
            eggs = required: list of eggs
        
            compile-mo-files = true/false; default is false
        
            extra-paths = optional list of additional paths
                that would not be found from eggs
                in multiple
                indented lines
        
            quiet = true/false; if true, common errors are only shown when buildout's
                verbose flag is set.
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        This recipe was created for use in Plone installers, but is hopefully useful in
        many buildout contexts.
        
        Change history
        ==============
        
        Changelog for plone.recipe.precompiler.
        
        0.6 (2012-12-17)
        ----------------
        
        - Use python_gettext rather than msgfmt to compile .po files. Removes
          dependence on gettext.
          (smcmahon)
        
        0.5
        ---
        
        - Suck up error messages and filter them to hide .po compile errors
          and .py "return outside function" errors when quiet option is true (default).
          (smcmahon)
        
        - Make the extra-paths work with the new working set method for finding eggs.
          (smcmahon)
        
        - Removed BBB code. The new way of finding eggs introduced by chaoflow is much
          better than my original.
          (smcmahon)
        
        - removed the functionality to automatically extract products directories from
          parts with the zope2instance recipe. This resulted in buildouts that always
          installed ALL parts. If you need the products dir, you must declare it explicitly
          like so: dirs = ${instance:products}
          (do3cc - 2012-07-12)
        
        
        0.4 (2010-08-12)
        ----------------
        
        - support for walking eggs dependencies, without skip/rx, manually tested.
          (chaoflow - 2010-08-12)
        
        - support for compiling mo files in those egg dirs, manually tested.
          (chaoflow - 2010-08-12)
        
        - kept old syntax and code, just don't specify eggs (untested)
        
        0.3
        ---
        
        - support to recursively compile list of dirs, with subdir blacklist and file
          blacklist regex.
