Description: Package releasing made easy: zest.releaser overview and installation
        ====================================================================
        
        zest.releaser is collection of command-line programs to help you automate the
        task of releasing a Python project.
        
        It does away with all the boring bits. This is what zest.releaser automates
        for you:
        
        * It updates the version number. The version number can either be in
          ``setup.py`` or ``version.txt``. For example, it switches you from
          ``0.3.dev0`` (current development version) to ``0.3`` (release) to
          ``0.4.dev0`` (new development version).
        
        * It updates the history/changes file. It logs the release date on release and
          adds a new heading for the upcoming changes (new development version).
        
        * It tags the release. It creates a tag in your version control system named
          after the released version number.
        
        * It optionally uploads a source release to PyPI. It will only do this if the
          package is already registered there (else it will ask, defaulting to 'no');
          zest releaser is careful not to publish your private projects!
        
        
        Most important URLs
        -------------------
        
        First the three most important links:
        
        - The full documentation is at `zestreleaser.readthedocs.org
          <http://zestreleaser.readthedocs.org>`_.
        
        - We're `on PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zest.releaser>`_, so we're only
          an ``pip install zest.releaser`` away from installation on your computer.
        
        - The code is at `github.com/zestsoftware/zest.releaser
          <https://github.com/zestsoftware/zest.releaser>`_.
        
        And... we're automatically being tested by Travis:
        
        .. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/zestsoftware/zest.releaser.png?branch=master
           :target: https://travis-ci.org/#!/zestsoftware/zest.releaser
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Just a simple ``pip zest.releaser`` or ``easy_install zest.releaser`` is
        enough.
        
        Alternatively, buildout users can install zest.releaser as part of a specific
        project's buildout, by having a buildout configuration such as::
        
            [buildout]
            parts =
                scripts
        
            [scripts]
            recipe = zc.recipe.egg
            eggs = zest.releaser
        
        
        Version control systems: svn, hg, git, bzr
        ------------------------------------------
        
        Of course you must have a version control system installed.  zest.releaser
        currently supports:
        
        - Subversion (svn).
        
        - Mercurial (hg).
        
        - Git (git).
        
        - Bazaar (bzr).
        
        Others could be added if there are volunteers! Git and mercurial support
        have been contributed years ago when we were working with bzr and subversion,
        for instance.
        
        
        
        Available commands
        ------------------
        
        Zest.releaser gives you four commands to help in releasing python
        packages.  They must be run in a version controlled checkout.  The commands
        are:
        
        - **prerelease**: asks you for a version number (defaults to the current
          version minus a 'dev' or so), updates the setup.py or version.txt and the
          CHANGES/HISTORY/CHANGELOG file (with either .rst/.txt/.markdown or no
          extension) with this new version number and offers to commit those changes
          to subversion (or bzr or hg or git)
        
        - **release**: copies the the trunk or branch of the current checkout and
          creates a version control tag of it.  Makes a checkout of the tag in a
          temporary directory.  Offers to register and upload a source dist
          of this package to PyPI (Python Package Index).  Note: if the package has
          not been registered yet, it will not do that for you.  You must register the
          package manually (``python setup.py register``) so this remains a conscious
          decision.  The main reason is that you want to avoid having to say: "Oops, I
          uploaded our client code to the internet; and this is the initial version
          with the plaintext root passwords."
        
        - **postrelease**: asks you for a version number (gives a sane default), adds
          a development marker to it, updates the setup.py or version.txt and the
          CHANGES/HISTORY/CHANGELOG file with this and offers to commit those changes
          to version control. Note that with git and hg, you'd also be asked to push
          your changes (since 3.27). Otherwise the release and tag only live in your
          local hg/git repository and not on the server.
        
        - **fullrelease**: all of the above in order.
        
        There are two additional tools:
        
        - **longtest**: small tool that renders a setup.py's long description
          and opens it in a web browser. This assumes an installed docutils
          (as it needs ``rst2html.py``).
        
        - **lasttagdiff**: small tool that shows the diff of the currently committed
          trunk with the last released tag.  Handy for checking whether all the
          changes are adequately described in the changes file.
        
        
        Credits
        =======

          originator and main author.
        
        * `Maurits van Rees <http://maurits.vanrees.org>`_ (Zest Software) added
          a heapload of improvements.
        
        * `Kevin Teague <http://bud.ca>`_ (Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences
          Center) added support for multiple version control systems, most notable
          Mercurial.
        
        * `Wouter vanden Hove <http://ugent.be>`_ (University of Gent) added
          support for uploading to multiple servers, using collective.dist.
        
        * `Godefroid Chapelle <http://bubblenet.be>`_ (BubbleNet) added /tag besides
          /tags for subversion.
        
        
        Changelog for zest.releaser
        ===========================
        
        3.43 (2013-02-04)
        -----------------
        
        - Added ``--no-input`` commandline option for running automatically without
          asking for input. Useful when started from some build tool. See the
          documentation at the end of
          http://zestreleaser.readthedocs.org/en/latest/uploading.html .
          [reinout, based upon a patch by j-san]
        
        
        3.42 (2013-01-07)
        -----------------
        
        - When finding multiple version, changes or history files, pick the
          one with the shortest path.
          [maurits]
        
        - Support project-specific hooks listed in setup.cfg.
          [iguananaut]
        
        
        3.41 (2012-11-02)
        -----------------
        
        - Getting the version from setup.py can give a traceback if the
          setup.py has an error.  During prerelease this would result in a
          proposed version of 'Traceback'.  Now we print the traceback and
          quit.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.40 (2012-10-13)
        -----------------
        
        - Support svn (1.7+) checkouts that are not directly in the root. Only applies
          when someone checks out a whole tree and wants to release one of the items
          in a subdirectory. Fixes #27.
        
        
        3.39 (2012-09-26)
        -----------------
        
        - Only search for files in version control.  This is when finding a
          history file or version.txt file.  We should not edit files that
          are not in our package.  Fixes issue #22.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.38 (2012-09-25)
        -----------------
        
        - Fixed svn tag extraction on windows: a ``\r`` could end up at the
          end of every tag name. Thanks Wouter Vanden Hove for reporting it!
        
        - Small fixes to the developers documentation and to the automatic `travis CI
          <http://travis-ci.org/#!/zestsoftware/zest.releaser/>`_ tests configuration.
        
        
        3.37 (2012-07-14)
        -----------------
        
        - Documentation update! Started sphinx documentation at
          `zestreleaser.readthedocs.org
          <http://zestreleaser.readthedocs.org>`_. Removed documentation from the
          README and put it into sphinx.
        
        - Actually ask if the user wants to continue with the release when
          there is no MANIFEST.in.  We asked for a yes/no answer, but the
          question was missing.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.36 (2012-06-26)
        -----------------
        
        - Improved changes/history file detection and fixed the documentation at this
          point. We now recognize CHANGES, HISTORY and CHANGELOG with .rst, .txt,
          .markdown and with no extension.
        
        - Set up `travis CI <http://travis-ci.org/#!/zestsoftware/zest.releaser/>`_
          integration. Our tests pass on python 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7.
        
        
        3.35 (2012-06-21)
        -----------------
        
        - When checking for recommended files, ask if the user wants to
          continue when we suspect the created PyPI release may be broken.
          See issue #10.
          [maurits]
        
        - Preserve existing EOL in setup.py and history file (See
          http://docs.python.org/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files)
          [tom_gross]
        
        
        3.34 (2012-03-20)
        -----------------
        
        - In the warning about a missing MANIFEST.in file, also suggest to
          install setuptools_subversion/git, etc.
          Fixes issue #4.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.33 (2012-03-20)
        -----------------
        
        - Fix python 2.4 issues with tarfile by always creating a zip file.
          Formerly we would only do this when using python2.4 for doing the
          release, but a tarball sdist created by python2.6 could still break
          when the end user is using python 2.4.
          [kiorky]
        
        
        3.32 (2012-03-09)
        -----------------
        
        - In prerelease recommend the user to add a MANIFEST.in file.
          See http://docs.python.org/distutils/sourcedist.html for
          more info.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.31 (2012-02-23)
        -----------------
        
        - Fixed test for unadvised egg_info commands on tag, which could
          result in a ConfigParser error.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.30 (2011-12-27)
        -----------------
        
        - Added some more PyPI classifiers.  Tested with Python 2.4, 2,4, 2.6,
          and 2.7.
          [maurits]
        
        - Moved changes of 3.15 and older to docs/HISTORY.txt.
          [maurits]
        
        - Added GPL license text in the package.
          [maurits]
        
        - Updated README.txt.  Added MANIFEST.in.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.29 (2011-12-27)
        -----------------
        
        - In postrelease create a version number like 1.0.dev0.
          See http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0386
          [maurits]
        
        - Offer to cleanup setup.cfg on the tag when releasing.  You do not
          want tag_build or tag_svn_revision options in a release usually.
          [maurits]
        
        - For convenience also print the tag checkout location when only doing
          a release (instead of a fullrelease).
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.28 (2011-11-18)
        -----------------
        
        - Git: in pre/postrelease only check for uncommitted changes in files
          that are already tracked.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.27 (2011-11-12)
        -----------------
        
        - Postrelease now offers (=asks) to push your changes to the server if you're
          using hg or git.
        
        - Support for some legacy projects, often converted from CVS, have multiple
          subprojects under a single trunk. The trunk part from the top level project
          isn't erroneously stripped out anymore. Thanks to Marc Sibson for the fix.
        
        
        3.26 (2011-11-01)
        -----------------
        
        - Added sanity check before doing a prerelease so you are warned when
          you are about to commit on a tag instead of a branch (or trunk or
          master).
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.25 (2011-10-28)
        -----------------
        
        - Removed special handling of subversion lower than 1.7 when searching
          for the history/changes file.  In corner cases it may be that we
          find a wrong HISTORY.txt or CHANGES.txt file when you have it buried
          deep in your directory structure.  Please move it to the root then,
          which is the proper place for it.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fixed finding a history/changes file that is in a sub directory when
          using subversion 1.7 or higher or bazaar.
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.24 (2011-10-19)
        -----------------
        
        - Note: you may need to install setuptools_subversion when you use
          subversion 1.7.  If you suddenly start missing files in the sdists
          you upload to PyPI you definitely need it.  Alternatively: set up a
          proper MANIFEST.in as that method works with any version control
          system.
          [maurits]
        
        - Made compatible with subversion 1.7 (the only relevant change is in
          the code that checks if a tags or tag directory already exists).
          Earlier versions of subversion are of course still supported.
          [maurits]
        
        - Code repository moved to github:
          https://github.com/zestsoftware/zest.releaser
          [maurits]
        
        
        3.23 (2011-09-28)
        -----------------
        
        - Fixed opening the html long description in ``longtest`` on Mac OS X
          Lion or python2.7 by using a ``file://`` url.
          Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/zest.releaser/+bug/858011
