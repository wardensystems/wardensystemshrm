Description: ``zope.mkzeoinstance`` README
        =============================
        
        This package provides a single script, ``mkzeoinstance``, which creates
        a standalone ZEO server instance.
        
        ``zope.mkzeoinstance`` Changelog
        ================================
        
        3.9.5 (2011-10-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Place the socket used by the ``zeoctl`` control process to conmmunicate
          with its ``runzeo`` daemaon in ``$INSTANCE_HOME/var``, instead of
          ``$INSTANCE_HOME/etc`` (which would idealy not be writable by the process).
          See: https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope.mkzeoinstance/+bug/175981
        
        
        3.9.4 (2010-04-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Renamed the script / package ``mkzeoinstance`` to avoid clashing with the
          script bundled with ZODB.
        
        - Added an option to spell the host interface to be listened on, as well as
          the port the generated ZEO server configuration.  Thanks to Igor Stroh
          for the patch.  See: https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/143361
        
        - Fixed generated templates to cope with the move of ``zdaemon`` code into
          its own project.
        
        - Forked from the version of the ``mkzeoinst`` script contained in
          ZODB 3.9.4.
