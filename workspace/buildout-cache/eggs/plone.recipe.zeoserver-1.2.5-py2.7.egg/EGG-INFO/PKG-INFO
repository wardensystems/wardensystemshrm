Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This recipe creates and configures a ZEO server in parts. It also installs a
        control script in the bin/ directory. The name of the control script is the
        name of the part in buildout.
        
        You can use it with a part like this::
        
          [zeo]
          recipe = plone.recipe.zeoserver
          zeo-address = 8100
        
        This will create a control script ``bin/zeo``.
        
        You can either start the database in foreground mode via ``bin/zeo fg`` or use
        the built-in zdaemon process control and use the ``start/stop/restart/status``
        commands. The foreground mode is suitable for running the process under general
        process control software like supervisord.
        
        Note: Windows support for this recipe is currently limited.
        
        Options
        -------
        
        The following options all affect the generated zeo.conf. If you want to have
        full control over the configuration file, see the ``zeo-conf`` option in the
        advanced options.
        
        Process
        -------
        
        zeo-address
          Give a port for the ZEO server (either specify the port number only (with
          '127.0.0.1' as default) or you use the format ``host:port``).
          Defaults to ``8100``.
        
        effective-user
          The name of the effective user for the ZEO process. Defaults to not setting
          an effective user. This causes the process to run under the user account the
          process has been started with.
        
        socket-name
          The filename where ZEO will write its socket file.
          Defaults to ``var/zeo.zdsock``.
        
        Storage
        -------
        
        storage-number
          The number used to identify a storage. Defaults to ``1``.
        
        file-storage
          The filename where the ZODB data file will be stored.
          Defaults to ``var/filestorage/Data.fs``.
        
        blob-storage
          The folder where the ZODB blob data files will be stored.
          Defaults to ``var/blobstorage``.
        
        Logging
        -------
        
        zeo-log
          The filename of the ZEO log file. Defaults to ``var/log/${partname}.log``.
        
        zeo-log-format
          Format of logfile entries. Defaults to ``%(asctime)s %(message)s``.
        
        zeo-log-custom
          A custom section for the eventlog, to be able to use another
          event logger than ``logfile``. ``zeo-log`` is still used to set the logfile
          value in the runner section.
        
        zeo-log-level
          Control the logging level in the eventlog. Defaults to ``info``.
        
        Authentication
        --------------
        
        authentication-database
          The filename for a authentication database. Only accounts listed in this
          database will be allowed to access the ZEO server.
        
          The format of the database file is::
        
            realm <realm>
            <username>:<hash>
        
          Where the hash is generated via::
        
            import sha
            string = "%s:%s:%s" % (username, realm, password)
            sha.new(string).hexdigest()
        
        authentication-realm
          The authentication realm. Defaults to ``ZEO``.
        
        Packing
        -------
        
        pack-days
          How many days of history should the zeopack script retain. Defaults to
          one day.
        
        pack-gc
          Can be set to ``false`` to disable garbage collection as part of the pack.
          Defaults to ``true``.
        
        pack-keep-old
          Can be set to ``false`` to disable the creation of ``*.fs.old`` files before
          the pack is run. Defaults to ``true``.
        
        pack-user
          If the ZEO server uses authentication, this is the username used by the
          zeopack script to connect to the ZEO server.
        
        pack-password
          If the ZEO server uses authentication, this is the password used by the
          zeopack script to connect to the ZEO server.
        
        Monitoring
        ----------
        
        monitor-address
          The address at which the monitor server should listen. The monitor server
          provides server statistics in a simple text format.
        
        Performance
        -----------
        
        invalidation-queue-size
          The invalidation-queue-size used for the ZEO server. Defaults to ``100``.
        
        Customization
        -------------
        
        var
          Used to configure the base directory for all things going into var.
          Defaults to ${buildout:directory}/var.
        
        zeo-conf-additional
          Give additional lines to zeo.conf. Make sure you indent any lines after
          the one with the parameter. This allows you to use generated zeo.conf file
          but add some minor additional lines to it.
        
        eggs
          Set if you need to include other packages as eggs e.g. for making
          application code available on the ZEO server side for performing
          conflict resolution (through the _p_resolveConflict() handler).
        
        extra-paths
          Specify additional directories which should be available to the control
          scripts. Use this only for non-eggified Python packages.
        
        zeo-conf
          A relative or absolute path to a zeo.conf file. This lets you provide a
          completely custom configuration file and ignore most of the options in
          this recipe.
        
        repozo
          The path to the repozo.py backup script. A wrapper for this will be
          generated in bin/repozo, which sets up the appropriate environment for
          running this. Defaults to using the repozo script from the ZODB3 egg.
          Set this to an empty value if you do not want this script to be generated.
        
        repozo-script-name
          The name of the wrapper script to generate in `bin/`. Defaults to `repozo`.
          Change this option if you have more than one instance of this recipe in
          the one buildout to create separate scripts and avoid any one script being
          overwritten.
        
        zeopack
          The path to the zeopack.py backup script. A wrapper for this will be
          generated in bin/zeopack (unless you change `zeopack-script-name`), which
          sets up the appropriate environment to run this. Defaults to using the zeopack
          script from the ZODB3 egg.  Set this option to an empty value if you do not
          want this script to be generated.
        
        zeopack-script-name
          The name of the wrapper script to generate in `bin/`. Defaults to `zeopack`.
          Change this option if you have more than one instance of this recipe in
          the one buildout to create separate scripts and avoid any one script being
          overwritten.
        
        relative-paths
          Set this to `true` to make the generated scripts use relative
          paths. You can also enable this in the `[buildout]` section.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        zeopack
          A zeopack script will be generated for you in the buildout bin directory,
          unless you change the `zeopack-script-name` option, in which case the script
          will be called the name you specify. If you'd like to use this script to pack
          a different mount point, you'll need to specify `-S mount_name`. You can also
          specify a `-B` option to not use the default blob directory.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.2.5 (2013-05-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Nothing changed yet.
        
        
        1.2.4 (2013-04-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Adding ability to control output script name for repozo. Use the
          ``repozo-script-name`` option to change the script name.
          [do3cc]
        
        
        1.2.3 (2012-10-03)
        ------------------
        
        - Adding ability to control output script name for zeopack. Use the
          ``zeopack-script-name`` option to change the script name.
          [davidjb]
        
        - Fix zeopack connection handling. The previous fix to abort after a failed
          connection attempt only worked by chance and caused zeopack to exit before
          the packing finished. Now failed connections are correctly detected and
          zeopack waits until the packing is finished.
          [gaudenz]
        
        1.2.2 (2011-11-24)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix custom zeo.conf support under windows.
          [rossp]
        
        
        1.2.1 - 2011-09-12
        ------------------
        
        - When the zeoserver is not running, the zeopack script cannot do
          anything.  So when zeopack cannot connect, it now quits with an
          error message.  Formerly it would wait forever.
          [maurits]
        
        - Added 'var' option like it is in plone.recipe.zope2instance.
          [garbas]
        
        1.2.0 - 2010-10-18
        ------------------
        
        - Only require a ``nt_svcutils`` distribution on Windows.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.1.1 - 2010-07-20
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed -B option being required for along with the -S option.
          [vangheem]
        
        - Added documentation for using the zeopack script with mount points.
          [vangheem]
        
        1.1 - 2010-07-18
        ----------------
        
        - No changes.
        
        1.1b1 - 2010-07-02
        ------------------
        
        - Implemented Windows support and support for running ZEO as a Windows service.
          We depend on the new nt_svcutils distribution to provide this support.
          [baijum, hannosch]
        
        - The FileStorage component of ZODB 3.9 now supports blobs natively,
          so no need to use BlobStorage proxy for it anymore.
          [baijum, hannosch]
        
        - Added ``extra-paths`` option to add additional modules paths.
          [baijum]
        
        - Fixed ZEO packing of mounted storage.
          [vangheem]
        
        - Added -B option to the ``zeopack`` script to specify the location of the
          blob storage.
          [vangheem]
        
        1.1a2 - 2010-05-10
        ------------------
        
        - Added support for the ``pack-keep-old`` option introduced in ZODB 3.9.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.1a1 - 2010-04-27
        ------------------
        
        - Added support for the ``pack-gc`` option introduced in ZODB 3.9.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Always create a blob-storage by default.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Require at least ZODB 3.8 and simplify the ``zeopack`` script.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Various documentation updates.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Use the new ``zope.mkzeoinstance`` package, which makes the recipe compatible
          with ZODB 3.9.5+.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed unmaintained win32 specific tests and old zope2 test mockups.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed testing dependency on ``zope.testing`` and refactored testing setup.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0 - 2010-04-05
        ----------------
        
        - Depend on and always include ZopeUndo. While it's only needed for Zope 2, the
          distribution is so tiny, it doesn't hurt for non-Zope 2 ZEO servers.
          [hannosch]
        
        1.0b1 - 2010-03-19
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed issue with egg paths for the zeopack script.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Added support for setting ZEO log level.
          [baijum]
        
        1.0a2 - 2009-12-03
        ------------------
        
        * Set up logging configuration that is needed by ZODB.blob.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Set shared_blob_dir to True when initializing the ClientStorage used
          by the pack script, since it will be using the same blob directory
          as the ZEO server.
          [davisagli]
        
        1.0a1 - 2009-12-03
        ------------------
        
        * Updated and cleaned up after renaming.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Added compatibility with eggified Zopes (Zope >= 2.12).
          [davisagli]
        
        * Initial implementation based on plone.recipe.zope2zeoserver.
